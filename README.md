# javafx-gradle-template
A template Java project for JavaFX GUI applications using gradle and basic dependencies.

It basically follows the tutorial described here: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle

I have added an example dependency that reads a CSV file (many of you look like they want something like that). A tutorial is here: https://www.callicoder.com/java-read-write-csv-file-apache-commons-csv/
